# Ourcade TypeScript

This project is still in development.  

Ourcade is a React TypeScript application with the end-goal of supporting user-curated scoreboards regarding pinball and arcade cabinet games.  The idea was born out of many conversations with fellow pinball and arcade gamers, as we discussed what sort of features we would like to see in an application to support our favorite hobby.  When I started learning TypeScript, I took a look at this idea again with the intention of building it out as a self-developed, self-supported, widely available web application.

Currently, we can CRUD users and scores, login/logout, and view an admin scoreboard which includes all current user scores.  We also have user-facing scoreboards implemented as well as some form validation with the rest to follow soon.

Lots of features are still in design or development, including:
- social features & leagues
- personal score analytics
- location-based score support
- score image support

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
